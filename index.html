        <h1 id="displaytext"> Hello survivor!</h1>

        <h2 id="output"> Once upon a time in April of  2021 the world turned bad when the Z’s started taking over. This all happened because a scientist named David. He was trying to create a stronger cure for the virus Covid-19 and it ended up doing the opposite effect and turned people who took this vaccine into Z’s. A lot of people think he did this on purpose. People that were turned into Z’s can turn people who didn't even take the vaccine into Z’s by biting them. David somehow survived this and he is still out there somewhere but no one knows. He is the main boss, most survivors are hunting him for what he has created and they are also trying to defeat him.</h2>
